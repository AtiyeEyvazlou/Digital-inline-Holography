# Digital-inline-Holography
In this project an image has been used as a Diffraction pattern, in the first step its propagation in distance z has been simulated. Next absolute value of the simulated image was taken (as what happens in cameras nowadays) to get reconstructed using the method introduced by Latychevskaia, T. and Fink, H.W. in [Practical algorithms for simulation and reconstruction of digital in-line holograms](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.54.002424) and [Solution to the Twin Image Problem in Holography](https://doi.org/10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.98.233901).
